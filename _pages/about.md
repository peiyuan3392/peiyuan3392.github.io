<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm **Peiyuan Zhu**, a first-year PhD student at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae">MBZUAI</a>, majoring in **Machine Learning**, fortunately supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RGoypN4AAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Kun Zhang</a>.

My research interests center around **temporal explainability and controllability**, with a particular emphasis on leveraging **provable causal representations**. On the application side, I have developed representation learning methods for sequential data, including video, text, and trajectory.

If you share similar interests or want to discuss cool ideas, feel free to connect.
