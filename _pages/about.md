# Welcome to Peiyuan‚Äôs Homepage!
Hi üëã, I'm Peiyuan Zhu (/Ààpe…™.jw√¶n zuÀê/), a first-year PhD student in Machine Learning Department at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae">MBZUAI</a>, fortunately supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RGoypN4AAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Kun Zhang</a>. My email address is peiyuan [dot] zhu [at] mbzuai [dot] ac [dot] ae.

## Research
My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision , Machine Learning , and Trustworthy AI, with a particular emphasis on temporal explainability and controllability with provable causal representations. On the application side, I have developed representation learning methods for sequential data, including video, text, and trajectory.

I am currently interested in any-time controllable video generation/editing, with the goal of understanding and controlling the latent cognitive processes in a principled way.
If you share similar interests or want to discuss cool ideas, feel free to connect.
